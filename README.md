# Semantic Book Recommender (Ongoing)

This project explores how large language models and semantic embeddings can improve content-based recommendation systems.
Being built using LangChain, OpenAI embeddings, and Gradio, the system suggests books by comparing the semantic meaning of their descriptions.
